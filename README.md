##CSEL-302 - Compilation of all the Exercises I did on the Subject

---

## Introduction 

- Welcome to my site!! In here, you are going to see the compilation of all of the exercises including the midterm activity that was tasked to do to us by our professor which is Mr. Bernardino. I will also Include here some informations and pictures of what are the topics that Sir Bernardino taught to us during lecture hours and before the laboratory hours. 

## Table Of Contents

4. [Midterm](#midterms)

## Topic Discussed

- **DEMISTIFYING AI AND INTRODUCTION TO INTELLIGENT AGENTS (Lesson 1) -** This topic inroduces us to the famous Artificial Intelligent. Sir discusses the history and the use of AI. Another is the Intelligent Agents that is related to the AI too, it's characteristics and types are part of this topic. 
- **DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION (Lesson 2) -** In this lecture, we are taught the different ways of data handling, from data collection, data preprocessing, EDA, data Processing techniques, and different data vusualization.  
- **PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS (Lesson 3) -** Computing the probability is the thing that we learned here with Sir Bernardino. Sir taught us first how to solve manually and then on the laboratory, he taught us the automatic way. 
- **LINEAR REGRESSION (Lesson 4) -** The whole concept of linear regression was taught to us by Sir here. What is linear regression and its types, also what are its application and how to code it to automatically get the regression. 
- **LOGISTIC REGRESSION (Lesson 5) -** Just like on the linear, the whole concept of logistic regression was taught to us by Sir here. Its application and how to code it to automatically get the regression also got discussed

## Conclusion
- Overall, I learned a lot during the half of the this semester and this compilation proves it. As you can see on this compilation, I finished each of it with such detail. To be honest, some of it are hard and quite confusing but I promise that you will get the hang of it after applying it. This was not easy but it is very worth it when you tried and finished it. From the introduction of AI to the logistic regression, it was all informative. I believe these informations will be able to help us students once we move up to highler level, it will be very useful.
