## CSEL 302 - Compilation of all the Exercises I did on the Subject

---

## Introduction 

- Welcome to my site!! In here, you are going to see the compilation of all of the exercises including the midterm activity that was tasked to do to us by our professor which is Mr. Bernardino. I will also Include here some informations and pictures of what are the topics that Sir Bernardino taught to us during lecture hours and before the laboratory hours. You will be able to see in this compilation the things I learned each topic and how did I apply it on every activity.

## Topic Discussed

- **DEMISTIFYING AI AND INTRODUCTION TO INTELLIGENT AGENTS (Lesson 1) -** This topic introduced us to the famous Artificial Intelligent. Sir discusses the history and the use of AI. Another is the Intelligent Agents that is related to the AI too, it's characteristics and types are part of this topic. 
- **DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION (Lesson 2) -** In this lecture, we are taught the different ways of data handling, from data collection, data preprocessing, EDA, data Processing techniques, and different data vusualization.  
- **PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS (Lesson 3) -** Computing the probability is the thing that we learned here with Sir Bernardino. Sir taught us first how to solve manually and then on the laboratory, he taught us the automatic way. 
- **LINEAR REGRESSION (Lesson 4) -** The whole concept of linear regression was taught to us by Sir here. What is linear regression and its types, also what are its application and how to code it to automatically get the regression. 
- **LOGISTIC REGRESSION (Lesson 5) -** Just like on the linear, the whole concept of logistic regression was taught to us by Sir here. Its application and how to code it to automatically get the regression also got discussed

## Definition of Terms

- **AI –** intelligence demonstrated by machines
- **Data Collection –** process of gathering information
- **Data Preprocessing –** process of getting your data ready for analysis or machine learning by cleaning, organizing and formatting it.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) –** a critical process in data analysis, serve as an initial step before diving into more in-depth analysis or modeling.
- **Probability –** implies likelihood or chance. (1 and 0).
- **Random Variable -** is a mathematical concept used to represent uncertain outcomes in probability and statistics. It is a variable that can take on different values with a certain probability associated with each value.
- **Probability Distributions –** describes the likelihood of each possible outcome for a random variable.
- **Linear Regression –** useful in understanding and modeling relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variable (features or predictors).
- **Dependent Variable –** responsible or outcome variable, is the variable that you measure or observe.
- **Independent Variable –** explanatory or predictable variable, is the variable that you manipulate or examine to see how it affects the dependent variable.
- **Logistic Regression –** statistical technique used for predicting the outcome of a categorial dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables (success/failure).

## Conclusion

- Overall, I learned a lot during the half of the semester and this compilation proves it. As you can see on this compilation, I finished each of the activities including the midterms with such detail. To be honest, some of it are hard and quite confusing but I promise that you will get the hang of it after applying it. This was not easy but it is very worth it when you tried and finished it. From the introduction of AI to the logistic regression, it was all informative. I believe these informations will be able to help us students once we move up to highler level, it will be very useful.
